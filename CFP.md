## Call for Papers

We invite submissions on the following topics of interest and more. Paper submission deadline: **September 27, 2021**. If you are interested in submitting a demo instead, please see [this page](demos.md) for details.

### Methodology and Algorithms:
- New methods and algorithms for controllability.
- Improvements of language and vision model architectures for controllability.
- Novel loss functions, decoding methods, and prompt design methods for controllability.
- Improved training and finetuning methods for controllability.
- Investigation of post-editing modeling paradigms including [Plug and Play (PPLMs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02164) for controllability.
- Unsupervised models such as [VAEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11975) and self-supervised approaches for controllability.

### Applications and Ethics:
- Applications of controllability including machine co-creativity, entertainment, data augmentation (for [text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03075) and [vision](https://journalofbigdata.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40537-019-0197-0)), ethics (e.g. bias and toxicity reduction), enhanced training for self-driving vehicles, and improving conversational agents.
- Some examples of creative AI and entertainment applications include controllable poetry, lyrics, music, image, and video generation.
- Ethical issues and challenges related to controllable generation including the risks and dangers of deepfake and fake news, and methods to mitigate and combat them.
- The introduction and exploration of new applications for controllability.

### Tasks:
Exploration of particular controllability tasks including:
- [Aspect-based summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.07832)
- [Semantic text exchange](https://aclanthology.org/D19-1272/)
- [Syntactically-controlled paraphrase generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.06059)
- Controlling the sentiment and politeness in generated text
- [Persona-based text generation](https://aclanthology.org/W19-3402/)
- Style-sensitive generation or style transfer (for [text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00416) and [vision](https://github.com/ycjing/Neural-Style-Transfer-Papers))
- Constrained generation tasks, including concept (or keywords) to text or image generation
- Image synthesis and scene representation in both 2D and 3D
- Cross-modal tasks such as controllable image or video captioning and generation from text

We also welcome the introduction and exploration of new controllability tasks.

### Evaluation and Benchmarks:
- Establishment of standard and unified metrics and benchmark tasks to efficiently and effectively compare different methods for controllable generation.
- The introduction and exploration of new evaluation methodology for controllability.

### Cross-Domain and Other Areas:
- Work in relevant domains to controllability such as interpretability, disentanglement, robustness, and representation learning.
- Papers from other areas that tie in with controllability such as neuroscience and cognitive science. 

### Position and Survey:
- Position and survey papers, including those looking at the problems and lacunae in current controllability formulations, neglected areas in controllability, and the unclear and non-standardized definition of controllability.

### Submission Instructions

Papers will be submitted using our [CMT submission portal](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/CtrlGen2021/Submission/Index) and go through double-blind review. Please ensure to select the "paper" category when submitting. Submissions should be a single .pdf file that is fully anonymized, with up to 8 pages of content and unlimited references and appendices, following the [NeurIPS style template](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2021/PaperInformation/StyleFiles). Supplementary material in the form of code and small data files can be submitted separately as a single .zip file. An option to upload supplementary material shows up in the author console after the paper is submitted. 

Accepted papers will be presented as posters and hosted on our workshop website. Note that the workshop is non-archival. While original submissions are preferred, we also welcome works currently under review, but discourage papers already accepted and published elsewhere, including at the NeurIPS main conference. We especially encourage submissions from those with diverse backgrounds, such as minority or underrepresented groups and junior researchers.

Feel free to contact us at [ctrlgenworkshop@gmail.com](mailto:ctrlgenworkshop@gmail.com) if you have any inquiries.
