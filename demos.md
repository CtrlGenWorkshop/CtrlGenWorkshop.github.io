## Call for Demonstrations

We invite submissions for demonstrations of controllable generation systems for both text and vision. Submission deadline: **October 29, 2021**. If you are interested in submitting a paper instead, please see [this page](CFP.md) for details.

We encourage demonstrations of all forms. This includes those for research and academic-related endeavors, but also demos of products, interesting and creative projects, and so forth. The main criteria for demonstrations will be how creative, well-presented, and attention-grabbing they are. Examples include the following:

- Creative AI such as controllable poetry, music, image, and video generation models.
- Style transfer for both text and vision. 
- Interactive chatbots and assistants that involve controllability.
- Controllable language generation systems, e.g. using GPT-2 or GPT-3.
- Controllable multimodal systems such as image and video captioning or generation from text.
- Controllable image and video/graphics enhancement systems.
- Systems for controlling scenes/environments and applications for self-driving vehicles.
- Controllability in the form of deepfake and fake news, specifically methods to combat them.
- And much, much more...


### Submission Instructions

Please record a brief (e.g. 3-5 minute) video showcasing and explaining your demo. Demonstrations will be submitted using our [CMT submission portal](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/CtrlGen2021/Submission/Index) in a single .zip file (containing the recording). Please ensure to select the "demo" category when submitting. Accepted demonstrations will be presented during our workshop and hosted on our workshop website. Feel free to contact us at [ctrlgenworkshop@gmail.com](mailto:ctrlgenworkshop@gmail.com) if you have any inquiries.
