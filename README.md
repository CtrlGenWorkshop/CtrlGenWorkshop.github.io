## Workshop Description

Over the past few years, there has been an increased interest in the areas of language and image generation within the ML, NLP, and Vision communities. As generated texts by models like GPT-3 start to sound more fluid and natural, and generated images and videos by GAN models appear more realistic, researchers began focusing on qualitative properties of the generated content such as the ability to control its style and structure, or incorporate information from external sources and other texts or images into the output. Such aims are extremely important to make language and image generation useful for human-machine interaction and other real-world applications including machine co-creativity, entertainment, ethical purposes, enhanced training for self-driving vehicles, and improving the ability of conversational agents and personal assistants to effectively interact.

Achieving these ambitious but important goals introduces challenges not only from NLP and Vision perspectives, but ones that closely pertain to Machine Learning as a whole, which has concurrently witnessed a growing body of work in relevant domains such as interpretability, disentanglement, robustness, and representation learning. We believe progress towards the realization of human-like language and image generation may benefit greatly from insights in these and other ML areas.

In this workshop, we propose to bring together researchers from the NLP, Vision, and ML communities to discuss the current challenges and explore potential directions for controllable generation and improve its quality, correctness, and diversity. As excitement about language and image generation has significantly increased recently thanks to the advent and improvement of large language models, transformer networks, and GANs, we feel this is the opportune time to hold a new workshop about this subject. We hope CtrlGen will foster discussion and interaction across NLP, Vision, and ML communities, including areas that range from structured prediction to disentanglement, and sprout fruitful cross-domain relations that may open the door for enhanced controllability in language and image generation.


## Call for Papers

We invite submissions on the following topics of interest and more.

### Methodology and Algorithms:
- New methods and algorithms for controllability.
- Improvements of language and vision model architectures for controllability.
- Novel loss functions, decoding methods, and prompt design methods for controllability.
- Improved training and finetuning methods for controllability.
- Investigation of post-editing modeling paradigms including [Plug and Play (PPLMs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02164) for controllability.
- Unsupervised models such as [VAEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11975) and self-supervised approaches for controllability.

### Applications and Ethics:
- Applications of controllability including machine co-creativity, entertainment, data augmentation (for [text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.03075) and [vision](https://journalofbigdata.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40537-019-0197-0)), ethics (e.g. bias and toxicity reduction), enhanced training for self-driving vehicles, and improving conversational agents.
- Ethical issues and challenges related to controllable generation including the risks and dangers of deepfake and fake news, and methods to mitigate and combat them.
- The introduction and exploration of new applications for controllability.

### Tasks:
Exploration of particular controllability tasks including:
- [Aspect-based summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.07832)
- [Semantic text exchange](https://aclanthology.org/D19-1272/)
- [Syntactically-controlled paraphrase generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.06059)
- Controlling the sentiment and politeness in generated text
- [Persona-based text generation](https://aclanthology.org/W19-3402/)
- Style-sensitive generation or style transfer (for [text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00416) and [vision](https://github.com/ycjing/Neural-Style-Transfer-Papers))
- Constrained generation tasks, including concept (or keywords) to text or image generation
- Image synthesis and scene representation in both 2D and 3D
- Cross-modal tasks such as controllable image or video captioning and generation from text

We also welcome the introduction and exploration of new controllability tasks.

### Evaluation and Benchmarks:
- Establishment of standard and unified metrics and benchmark tasks to efficiently and effectively compare different methods for controllable generation.
- The introduction and exploration of new evaluation methodology for controllability.

### Cross-Domain and Other Areas:
- Work in relevant domains to controllability such as interpretability, disentanglement, robustness, and representation learning.
- Papers from other areas that tie in with controllability such as neuroscience and cognitive science. 

### Position and Survey:
- Position and survey papers, including those looking at the problems and lacunae in current controllability formulations, neglected areas in controllability, and the unclear and non-standardized definition of controllability.

### Submission Instructions

Papers will be submitted using our [CMT submission portal](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/CtrlGen2021/Submission/Index) and go through double-blind review. Submissions should be a single .pdf file that is fully anonymized, with up to 8 pages of content and unlimited references and appendices, following the [NeurIPS style template](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2021/PaperInformation/StyleFiles). Supplementary material in the form of code and small data files can be submitted separately as a single .zip file. An option to upload supplementary material shows up in the author console after the paper is submitted.

Accepted papers will be presented as posters and hosted on our workshop website. Note that the workshop is non-archival. While original submissions are preferred, we also welcome works currently under review, but discourage papers already accepted and published elsewhere, including at the NeurIPS main conference. We especially encourage submissions from those with diverse backgrounds, such as minority or underrepresented groups and junior researchers.

Feel free to contact us at [ctrlgenworkshop@gmail.com](mailto:ctrlgenworkshop@gmail.com) if you have any inquiries.
